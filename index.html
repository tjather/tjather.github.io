                <p>
                    My name is <span class="highlight-name">Talha Ather</span>, a
                    lifelong learner committed to building tools that serve real people
                    and meaningful causes. While I recently graduated with a
                    <span class="highlight-name">
                        Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, summa cum laude</span>, with a 3.97 GPA, my journey has
                    taken me from the technical
                    depths of full-stack development, networking systems, and machine
                    learning to the transformative study of the Islamic sciences with
                    Qalam Seminary. This journey has shaped not just what I do, but why
                    I do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At heart, I love solving problems not just with code, but with
                    intention and care. This drive led me to co-found GoodWatt, a
                    sustainability startup addressing phantom energy waste. Leading the
                    technical development of our preorder platform, I architected and
                    implemented a scalable web application using
                    <span class="highlight-name">React, TypeScript, and Stripe</span>
                    for seamless payments and user experience. I was humbled to see our
                    work recognized with first-place awards at CU Boulder's 2024
                    Sustainability Hackathon and the 2025 Social Impact New Venture
                    Challenge. These experiences taught me the power of turning ideas
                    into solutions that genuinely impact lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also had the chance to contribute to Total Expert, where I worked
                    on a large-scale marketing automation platform. My focus was on
                    refactoring backend systems using
                    <span class="highlight-name">PHP</span>, developing modular UI
                    components in <span class="highlight-name">Vue.js</span>, and
                    improving data processing using
                    <span class="highlight-name">SQL</span> and
                    <span class="highlight-name">ElasticSearch</span>. It was a
                    fast-paced environment that sharpened my ability to debug complex
                    systems, write clean, testable code, and think holistically about
                    how products scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I have learned is that impact is not measured by quantity
                    alone, but by quality. This mindset guides me as I blend technical
                    skills with personal values, always aiming to build, learn, and
                    serve with intention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you share this passion for meaningful work or want to connect, I
                    would love to hear from you!
